[Strongly Recommended] Write your task first before adding a timer!

1. Assign a shortcut for the command "Text Block Timer: Toggle timer" for quick access
2. Place your cursor on a text block, press the shortcut to start, pause, or continue

### (2) Mouse Operations

1. Right-click on a text line
2. Select "Start Timer", "Pause Timer", or "Continue Timer"
3. The timer will display in the format `„Äê‚è≥00:00:00 „Äë` at the start of the text block

## Notes

- It is recommended to keep the file (containing a running tiemr) open; otherwise, the real-time second updates of the timer may fail.
- However, the file will record the timer state, which can be manually resumed.
